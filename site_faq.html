<b>How does the system work and who wrote it?</b>
<menu>
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5113" target="_blank">Meeting Room Booking System</a>
is open source software that is distributed under the Gnu Public License(GPL). MRBS was originally written by  Daniel Gardner, and has been converted to a court booking system by <a href="http://www.jupiterwill.co.uk" target="_blank">Jupiterwill</a>
</p>
<p>
The system is written mostly in <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, 
which is an open source programming language that can be embedded in web 
pages similar in concept to Microsoft active server pages.  PHP is especially 
good at accessing databases.
</p>
<p>  
The database used for the system is either
<a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">MySQL</a>
or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>.
MySQL is a very fast, multi-threaded, multi-user and robust 
SQL (Structured Query Language) database server that is also GPL.
PostgreSQL is a full-featured multi-user open source Object Relational SQL
database server.
</p>
<p> 
The system will run on multiple platforms, including the PC architecture
using the <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_blank">Linux</a> operating system.
Linux, is an open source, unix-like operating system.
</p>
<p>
The web server being used is yet another piece of open source
software.  The <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache</a> web server is
the world's most popular web server.
